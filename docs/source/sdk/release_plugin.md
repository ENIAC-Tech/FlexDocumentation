# Release Your Plugin

This guide explains how to publish your plugin.

## GitHub Actions

Plugins created with `flexcli` come pre-configured with GitHub Actions. To publish your plugin, simply push your code to a GitHub repository and create a Release. Note that your Release Tag must match the plugin version specified in the `manifest.json` file. The GitHub CI will automatically compile and publish the `*.flexplugin` file to the Release assets.

You can then share the `*.flexplugin` file or the GitHub repository link for users to import the plugin in the key library.

## Submit to FlexMarketplace

If you want to share your plugin with a broader audience, you can publish it to FlexMarketplace.

> FlexMarketplace is currently under development. This documentation will be updated upon its official release.
