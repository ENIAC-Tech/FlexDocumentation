# Cycle Button

The cycle button function cycles between multiple key/ functions when pressed. Only the currently displayed function would be executed. If you need executing multiple operations at once, check out the 'sequence' function.

## In the FlexDesigner

Because the cycle button function is merely a container for other functions, it doesn't have the usual background and foreground settings. The only available tab is the function tab, where the list of functions to cycle through can be defined.

To define the functions, drag and drop desired functions from the right pane into the middle area. Note that when in the function tab, only functions that can be used with cycle buttons would be displayed.

By default, functions are cycled through in order. It's also possible to switch to random order by clicking on the ordering button top right to the action list.

## On the Flexbar

Press the button to execute the currently displayed function. Once done, the next function would be displayed on the button.
