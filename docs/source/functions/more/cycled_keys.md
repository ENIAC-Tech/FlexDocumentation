# Cycled Keys

The cycled keys cycles between multiple keys when pressed. Only the currently displayed key would be executed. If you need executing multiple operations at once, check out the 'Sequenced Keys'.

## In the FlexDesigner

Because the cycled keys is merely a container for other keys, it doesn't have the usual background and foreground settings. The only available tab is the function tab, where the list of keys to cycle through can be defined.

To define the keys, drag and drop desired key from the right pane into the middle area. Note that when in the function tab, only keys that can be used with the cycle key would be displayed.

By default, keys are cycled through in order. It's also possible to switch to random order by clicking on the ordering button top right to the action list.

## On the Flexbar

Press the key to execute the currently displayed key. Once done, the next key would be displayed on the key.
