# Scroll Wheel

The scroll wheel key shows a scroll wheel on the screen, and the operation can be bind to keys, mouse or media control input.

This feature emulates a standard USB keyboard with multimedia keys. It works on any devices without having FlexDesigner running.

## In the FlexDesigner

The scroll wheel can trigger different actions when it's being scrolled to the left or right. The action can be specified in the function tab. Each direction can trigger keyboard, mouse, multimedia, or any combination of these actions.

See keyboard, mouse, and multimedia page for details.

The scroll wheel's length is fixed. However, it's possible to set the key to occupy larger area to show additional label or icon. By default, it shows a scroll wheel icon on the left side of the actual wheel. This can be disabled by disable the icon option in the foreground tab, and set the width to minimum in the background page.

The scroll wheel's sensitivity can be controlled in the 'common' tab. By default, it triggers an action every 5 steps scrolled. This can be adjusted higher for a lower sensitivity, or lower for a higher sensitivity.

## On the Flexbar

A scrollable wheel would appear at the defined location. Scroll the wheel to trigger defined actions.
