# Keyboard & Mouse

The keyboard & mouse key sends keys and mouse event with one click. One use case would be using it to implement shortcut like 'Ctrl + Click' or 'Ctrl + Scroll'.

This feature emulates a set of standard USB keyboard and mouse. It works on any devices without having FlexDesigner running.
