You can find this feature under the "Minecraft" category in the Key Library.

## On the Flexbar

You can view your entire inventory and click on any item to equip it in Steve’s hand.

> Fun fact: if you set the width of Inventory Monitor to **2170**, Flexbar will perfectly display the entire inventory without scrolling.
