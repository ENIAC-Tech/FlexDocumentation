# Microphone Control

The microphone control key allows controlling system audio input volume.

This key only works when the FlexDesigner is running. This key is only present in the Windows version of the FlexDesigner at the moment.

## In the FlexDesigner

Other than the standard visual options, this key doesn't have any additional configurable functions in the FlexDesigner.

## On the Flexbar

Drag the slider on the Flexbar to adjust system input volume (typically microphone volume).
