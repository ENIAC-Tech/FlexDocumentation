# Performance Chart

The performance chart key displays computer performance data charts.

## In the FlexDesigner

There are various options in the FlexDesigner for this key. Overall, it allows configuration for:

- Data source: specify the performance metric (such as CPU usage, network throughput, etc.) to display
- Label options: setting the appearance of the text label
- Chart options: setting the appearance of the chart

Label and chart and be enabled and disabled independently. To disable the label display, switch off the check box named 'Label'. To disable the chart, set the chart type to 'Label' in the list box named 'Chart Type'.

The auto-scale feature always scale the highest value in the chart to the maximum. This might be confusing as the chart could be a bit busy while the actual number is low. To avoid this, disable the auto-scale feature.

As the chart would be displayed in the allocated area, it's recommended to disable any foreground elements and keep background clear for this key.

## On the Flexbar

The selected chart would be displayed in the area allocated for this feature. This is no interactive actions for this key.
