# Workspace

The workspace key arranges the window layout to a predefined state. It works by first capture the window layout (workspace) in the FlexDesigner. Later, when the key is pressed, it restores the window layout to the previously recorded state. So that when you need to start working, simply press this key to set up the workspace so you can start working right away. This function only works when the FlexDesigner is running.

## In the FlexDesigner

When this key is first added to the page, the FlexDesigner automatically captures/ records the current window layout. The window layout is shown in the list in the function tab.

Up right to the list, there are two buttons: recapture and test run. The first one replaces the existing list with the current window layout. The test run button arranges the window as defined in the list, as if the key is pressed on the Flexbar.

For each window, the bounds (XY coordinate, width, height, and scale) can be manually modified. Right to these input boxes are 4 buttons: refresh, edit, delete, and test run. The refresh button recaptures the position for the selected window. The edit buttons provide additional settings for the window, such as the path to the application, and the strategy used for opening the window (always open a new one, find existing one, etc.). The delete button removes the window from the list. The test run button restores the position and size for this specific window for testing purposes.

## On the Flexbar

Press the key to arrange the window layout as defined.
