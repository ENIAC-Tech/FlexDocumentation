## Sleep

This key puts the computer to sleep when pressed.

This key only works when the FlexDesigner is running. If this is not desired, consider using the 'Multimedia' key in the 'Input' category and set the function to 'Power Control' â†’ 'Sleep'. The multimedia key works without the FlexDesigner, but the exact handling would be subject to the operating system settings.

To put the Flexbar to sleep, check out the 'Flexbar Sleep' key in the 'Device Control' category.
