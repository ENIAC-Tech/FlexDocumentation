The main interface of FlexDesigner consists of three sections:

1. [Page Editor](page_editor.md): This area displays the same effects as Flexbar, allowing you to preview and adjust each interface of Flexbar
2. [Key Editor](key_editor.md): Here you can edit the appearance and functionality of keys
3. [Key Library](key_library.md): Lists all preset/imported keys that you can drag and drop into the page editor or key editor
4. [Toolbar](toolbar.md): Contains file management, software configuration, and other functions.
