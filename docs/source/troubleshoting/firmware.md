# Firmware

Firmware refers to the embedded software written into Flexbar's internal microcontroller, pre-installed at the factory. Updates to firmware are prompted via FlexDesigner when available. We recommend regularly updating to ensure access to the latest features and improved stability.

## Update your firmware

### Automatic Update

When a firmware update is available, FlexDesigner will display the following prompt. We recommend updating as soon as possible.

### Manual Update

**Under normal circumstances, you do not need to manually update your firmware. If a necessary firmware update is available, FlexDesigner will notify you.**

Go to `Setting -> Device`

Click `UPLOAD FIRMWARE`, then wait for the firmware upload to complete and the device to restart automatically.

**Note: Do not disconnect power during the update process**

### After update, device shows "Profile version does not match..."

It's normal for your device to display this screen after an update. The update requires you to re-upload your Profile to ensure the device is running the latest version. You simply need to upload your Profile again to resolve this.
