Uploading a Plugin works slightly differently. We require Plugins to be hosted on GitHub. Simply enter your repository URL, and FlexGate will verify its validity.

> Make sure your repository was created with FlexCLI and has a valid plugin structure. Check out the [SDK documentation](sdk/index.html) to learn how to create custom plugins
