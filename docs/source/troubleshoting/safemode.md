# Safe Mode

When in Safe Mode, Flexbar doesn't load any profiles. This mode is designed to prevent the device from becoming unusable due to crashes caused by profile loading failures, ensuring you can still update firmware or profiles.

## How to Enter Safe Mode

### Automatic Entry

- The device automatically enters Safe Mode after updating to new firmware. You'll need to download your profiles again.
- If the device detects a crash, it will automatically enter Safe Mode. You can try downloading your profiles again. If crashes persist, please submit your profile to `contact@eniacelec.com` for support and to help us improve.

### Manual Entry

During the startup LOGO screen, you can find a subtle `Enter SafeMode` button on the left side. Tap this button to manually enter Safe Mode.
